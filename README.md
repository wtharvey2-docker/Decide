# Decide
A program designed to allow a group to make a decision that gives everyone a say and minimizes the time spent between options that people are equally indifferent between.

This document starts with a description of the tool and when to use it. The next part is a step-by-step walkthrough. The last part talks about further development in the works and how you can help.

## 1. Description
  The idea behind *Decide* is to take the difficulty out of making small group decisions like where to eat, what game to play, or what activity to do. The basic process is that you first state what the question is that you're trying to answer, which is then followed by everyone submitting their ideas. After that, people can optionally vote and/or reject ideas before the program selects an answer for the group. Options are available at the beginning to allow the group to choose whether they want to vote or just have a random decision between the options they come up with. Overall, *Decide* has been made with the intention of making the process as easy as possible while also trying to minimize the number of ways that people can game the system so that the group can get a fair decision.
  
  This tool is not meant to make important decisions and should not be used to randomize decisions like how many children to have, what country to move to, or how much to bet on the Cubs winning another World Series. It's intended for daily use in situations like deciding where to go for lunch with your friends or which streaming service to buy if you have to shelter-in-place again.

## 2. How to Use



## 3. Development

Any problems, comments, or ideas are greatly appreciated. I made this because I don't like spending half an hour trying to figure out what everyone has eaten in the last week to try to agree on where to eat dinner with a group. I hope you find other uses for this and let me know so that I can make it better for your daily questions. You can reach me at wtharvey2@gmail.com.

Future features may include:
- Presets where you can save options for repeated use.
- Ways to use external files or data to provide options (like if you have a spreadsheet of restaurants you like)
- Re-vote/re-decide with a different method
- Easier-to-use interface (open to suggestions for what this may look like)
